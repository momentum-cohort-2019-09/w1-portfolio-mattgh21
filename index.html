                <p>
                    Currently I am a student at Momentum Learning where I am learning the fundamentals of Web Development. I recently developed an interest in learning to code after graduating for UNC and realizing that I was no longer passionate about what I study there.
                    Now I'm learning how to build websites using HTML and style them using CSS. I especially enjoy the aspects of coding that involve problem-solving and analysis.

            <p>
                I started playing Ultimate in High School at Carolina Friends School. Since then I played two season of YCC with the Triangle U20 Boys team, Triforce, winning the National Championship in 2014 and taking second in 2015. I recently completed my 5 years
                of college eligibility playing with UNC Darkside where we won 2 National Championships and made 5 straight semifinal appearances. I captained Darkside for 3 years, and I am now in my second year captaining Ring of Fire, the Elite Men’s
                Club team from Raleigh. I have also had the fortune of playing for and winning gold with the USA U-24 Mixed National Team in 2018 and 2019 in Germany and Australia, respectively.

            <p>
                I started coaching during my sophomore year of college at Phillips MS. I coached there for 1 year, before coaching Carolina Freinds MS for the 3 years. I’ve been an assistant coach for the CFS high school team for 4 years, and have also been an assistant
                coach for the Triangle’s U20 Boys YCC Team, TriForce, for 4 seasons. I am currently coaching the Triangle Tourists Boys Club Team, as well as my former college team, UNC Darkside.
