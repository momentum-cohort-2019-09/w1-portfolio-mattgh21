                    In this assignment we were asked to build a website for a small business, the Lasy River Nursery and Garden Supply store. The website had three pages: a homepage, a page dedicated to the list of plants currently in stock, and a location with information
                    about the storeâ€™s hours and location. The homepage included general information about the business, and the currently in stock page detailed several different plants that were available at the store. For this assignment we were asked
                    to use HTML to build the website, which included text, pictures, and links to the three different pages.

                    For this assignment we were asked to build a webpage identical to mockup provided to us beforehand. We were required to use HTML to build the website and then use CSS to style the page to match the mockup we had been given. In addition to using HTML and
                    CSS, we got experience with more nuanced CSS techniques like Flexbox. The page itself was for a dog adoption site that allowed customers to view dogs that were avaialable for adoption. Additionally, customers could indicate any specific
                    dog traits they were interested in using a form.
